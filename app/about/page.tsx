          My journey in AI started during my university years where I learned about deep learning, computer vision, 
          and natural language processing. Since then, Iâ€™ve been actively involved in developing applications that 
          combine these technologies with modern software engineering practices.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I'm proficient in technologies such as Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
          Feel free to check out my projects below or get in touch with me if you want to collaborate on something exciting!
